## Welcome to SkyBot ðŸš€

SkyBot is an advanced air traffic control (ATC) communication simulator designed for student pilots. By mimicking real-world scenariosâ€”from ground operations and takeoffs to emergenciesâ€”it provides a cost-effective and flexible way to improve your ATC communication skills.

SkyBot was created to address a gap in aviation training: the lack of active, realistic practice for ATC communications. With our platform, you can:

- Practice in a variety of scenarios, including emergency situations.
- Train with AI-powered simulations that adapt to different airspaces, airports, and real-time conditions.
- Build confidence and expertise in handling diverse communication challenges.

Letâ€™s dive in to learn how to use SkyBot effectively.
